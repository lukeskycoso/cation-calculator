# cation-calculator
A python script for calculating cations from EMP raw data by Luca Reato, Comenius University in Bratislava (Slovakia).

The script is very easy to use and to understand.

System requirements:
- having installed Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

How do I start it?
You can start your script from the terminal: move to the folder where the script is contained and then type: "python cation.py".
Another technique could be to open the terminal, drag the file "cation.py", that will give you the path, and just add "python" before it.

How does it work?
The program is very simple at the moment. It will ask you to prompt the number of cations and of oxygens in the ideal formula you want to calculate. Fore example: 4 cations and 6 oxygens for pyroxene.

After this, it will ask you to prompt the complete pathname of the file you want to elaborate. Remember to specify the name of the file AND the extension!

After this, the calculation will procede automatically, and the file "output.csv" will be produced in the folder where the script is saved.

If you run it multiple times, please rembember to rename the file "output.csv" or to store it in another folder, otherwise it will be overwritten!

I hope you enjoy this small project. It is free to use, but if you use it for some publication, please remember to cite it, it would help me a lot :)
